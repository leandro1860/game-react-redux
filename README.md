### `App description`

A web application that is based on a game where you must defeat the monster by sending cards that produce effects that may or may not damage it. And so also the monster performs the same sequence to damage the player. For each turn a card is chosen.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
